Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

2. Case Study Analysis

Read the article: AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines.

Answer: How does AIOps improve software deployment efficiency? Provide two examples.

Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)
Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

Tool: Use a code completion tool like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.

Task:

Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

Compare the AI-suggested code with your manual implementation.

Document which version is more efficient and why.

Deliverable: Code snippets + 200-word analysis.

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

Framework: Use Selenium IDE with AI plugins or Testim.io.

Task:

Automate a test case for a login page (valid/invalid credentials).

Run the test and capture results (success/failure rates).

Explain how AI improves test coverage compared to manual testing.

Deliverable: Test script + screenshot of results + 150-word summary.

Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Dataset: Use Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset.

Goal:

Preprocess data (clean, label, split).

Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).

Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score.

Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook + performance metrics.

Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

Prompt: Your predictive model from Task 3 is deployed in a company. Discuss:

Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams).

How fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.
